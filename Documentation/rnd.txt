3. 135 files data leakage from training to test data in FoR dataset. (real audios)
    11 files data leakage from training to test data in FoR dataset (fake audios)
    3 files overlapped from the validation set. (fake)

    430 files overlapped overall between fake and real dataset.



4. Models trained log: 
    Two models trained, first with new features and bad performance, second with new features but heavier models but still bad performance.
