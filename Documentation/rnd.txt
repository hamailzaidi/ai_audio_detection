3. 135 files data leakage from training to test data in FoR dataset. (real audios)
    11 files data leakage from training to test data in FoR dataset (fake audios)
    3 files overlapped from the validation set. (fake)

    430 files overlapped overall between fake and real dataset.


    the above duplication was only in file names, and the audios were different from each other. 
    data_validator.py was created to verify the signal difference, also a few were manually checked as well.
